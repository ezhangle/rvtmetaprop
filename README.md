# RvtMetaProp

Revit C# .NET add-in to import and store meta properties created
in [Philippe Leefsma](https://github.com/leefsmp)'s
[Forge Configurator &ndash; Meta Properties](https://forge-rcdb.autodesk.io/configurator?id=59780eec17d671029c53420e) sample.

- Look at
the [online Forge configurator sample](https://forge-rcdb.autodesk.io/configurator).
- Scroll down through the models to *Meta Properties*.
- In the left-hand drop-down menu, select *Office*.
- Click on the *Meta Properties* box.

The office model is displayed, and its properties displayed in a panel on the right-hand side.

You can select any BIM element and see all its properties as well.

The buttons on the right-hand side of the property panel enable search, export to `CSV` and `JSON`, and adding new properties.

Each property can also be deleted.
